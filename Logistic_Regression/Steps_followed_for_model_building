This data set is from UCI Machine learning repository ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data) )
This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks.
The data set has 20 attributes excluding the target. Out of 20 attributes 13 are categorical.

The variable "target" is created from the variable "good_or_bad" as follows:
    when good_or_bad=1 then target=0 else 1

For all categorical variables WOE ( weight of evidence is calcuated ) and WOE of those variables are used. 
E.g for variable "status_of_existing_checking_account" WOE is calculated and stored in 
    variable "status_of_existing_checking_account_encoded" and that is used for model building.

Except the target variable all variables are scaled.

Data is partitioned into train & test. Train data has 75% of the observations and test 25%

Step wise Logistic regression model is performed  with binomial family  using all variables.

At each step variable which has high probability value ( not significant ) is removed.

Finally found the below variables ( predictors ) having less probabiltity value ( more significant ) is found.

status_of_existing_checking_account_encoded
duration_in_month
credit_history_encoded
purpose_encoded
savings_account_or_bonds_encoded
present_employment_since_encoded
installment_rate
other_debtors_or_gurantors_encoded
housing_encoded
foreign_worker_encoded

Achieved Area under the curve ( ~76% )  & Accuracy ( ~78% )
